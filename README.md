# A graphing calculator that lets you decide what engine you should use.

This is literally that. 

Due to recent unity price changes, unity (my go to engine) may not be worth it. Specially since Unity decided to charge per new device. This means that using unity might not be a good idea, but it depends on the project. 

After doing some experimenting, i concluded that for successful games, if you want to use unity, you must charge more than 1.5 usd per copy. If you charge less than this (or make a free game), it is simply not worth it.

If you have other games, or other sources of revenue, you are basically screwed if you sell it for less than 1.5USD (specially for dev teams of 2 or more people), since a game that is literally making nothing will cost a crap ton.

If you are making games in Unity, and your game does well, it still makes a better price than unreal engine. but you need to be thinking in selling more than 500,000 copies to make it worth it. 

Still, this is your decision, i am just giving info. 

## run the code 

Just run `InteractiveGraphics.py` on python, and an interactive interface will pop out. You need matplotlib to run it

run: `pip install matplotlib`
